# mtraceR
mtraceR is an R package to analyse migration-n output

## Quickstart
Install the package from version control from within R:
```
library(devtools)
install_github("carlopacioni/mtraceR")
```
If you are on Windows and have not used `devtools` before, then you have to 
download the Rtools executable file from CRAN webpage and run it. `devtools` can 
be installed from within R with 
```
install.packages("devtools")
```

This is a development version. Functions arguments and their implementation may 
change with no warnings.
Limited testing has been conducted with migrate-n outputs from sequence and 
microsatellite data only.
